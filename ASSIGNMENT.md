# Assignment 04 - Website Automation Agent

## Assignment Overview

Create an intelligent website automation agent capable of interacting with web pages autonomously. This project serves as a mini-version of browser automation tools like Browser Use, demonstrating your understanding of AI-driven browser control and web automation.

## Project Objective

Build an automation agent that can navigate to a specific URL, interact with web elements, and perform form-filling operations without manual intervention. Your agent should demonstrate intelligent decision-making in identifying and manipulating web page elements.

## Target Task

Your automation agent must perform the following task:

- Navigate to: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/forms/react-hook-form
- Identify the form elements on the page (Name and Description fields)
- Automatically fill in the Name and Description

## Technical Requirements

### Required Tools & Technologies

#### Browser Automation Library (Choose one):

- Playwright (Recommended)
- Puppeteer

#### Programming Language:

- Any language of your choice (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.)

### Core Functionalities to Implement

Your agent must include the following tools/capabilities:

- `take_screenshot` - Capture the current state of the browser window
- `open_browser` - Initialize and launch a browser instance
- `Maps_to_url` - Direct the browser to a specific URL
- `click_on_screen(x, y)` - Perform mouse clicks at specified coordinates
- `send_keys` - Input text into form fields or text areas
- `scroll` - Scroll the page to reveal hidden elements
- `double_click` - Perform double-click actions when necessary

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Agent Architecture**: Design your agent with modular tools that can be composed together
- **Element Detection**: Implement intelligent element identification using selectors, XPath, or visual recognition
- **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling for network issues, element not found, and timeout scenarios
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging to track agent actions and decisions
- **Configuration**: Use environment variables or configuration files for API keys and settings

## Project Deliverables

- **Source Code**: Complete, well-documented codebase with clear comments
- **README File**: Include setup instructions, dependencies, and how to run the agent
- **Architecture Document**: Brief explanation of your design decisions and agent workflow

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated during your viva based on:

- **Functionality (40%)**: Does the agent successfully complete the target task?
- **Code Quality (25%)**: Is the code clean, modular, and well-documented?
- **Agent Intelligence (20%)**: How well does the agent handle element detection and decision-making?
- **Error Handling (10%)**: Robustness in handling edge cases and failures
- **Documentation (5%)**: Quality of README and inline code comments

## Submission Guidelines

- **Deadline**: No fixed deadline — evaluation will occur during your viva voce examination
- **Presentation**: Be prepared to demonstrate your agent live during the viva
